# Resistors

- The DC resistance of a conductor made using a material with a resistivity, &rho;, has a cross-sectional area, A, and a length, l, is given by,
\\[ R\_\text{dc} = \frac{\rho\cdot l}{A} \\]
- A resistor is thus made using a conductor that has specific length and a cross-sectional area, which gives the required resistance
 - The conductor is typically arranged as a helix to reduce the size of the resistor 
- As a practical resistor uses a certain length of wire,typically in a helix arrangement, it not only has resistance but also has some inductance 
 - A practical resistor can be modelled as a resistance, R, and an Equivalent Series Inductance, ESL

]

- Constructed by depositing a conducting film of carbon, metal or metal oxide on to an non-conducting substrate like ceramic
 - Most common type of resistors used in electronics circuitry 
 - The type of conducting film used lead to some unique properties 
- A high precision helix grooved on to the conducting film using a laser allows much smaller tolerances in resistance
 - An epoxy coating is used to protect the conducting film 
- These resistors are rated to about 125V-350V and the power rating can be up to a few Watts

]

- Constructed by winding a thin metal alloy wire in form of a helix around an insulator
 - Winding is encapsulated in a non-conducting potting material 
 - Some devices have a metal housing with fins to dissipate the heat effectively (i.e., a heatsink)
- These resistors have high-current and high-power ratings 
 - Typically used as load resistors (e.g., variable load used in this project)
- The larger number of turns and the cross-sectional area result in a significantly higher ESL 
 - Thus, not suitable in some applications (e.g., current sense resistor)

]

- Constructed using a sliding or a rotating contact to provide an adjustable resistance
- Usually a three terminal resistor where there is a terminal at each end of the resistor 
 - The third terminal is connected to the sliding/rotating contact 
- The third terminal forms an adjustable voltage divider 
 - Commonly used in applications such as volume control 
- Can be used in places where the resistance need to be trimmed/calibrated to provide greater accuracy
 - Value can change over time for example due to vibrations

# Resistor Marking

.left-column-s[
- TH axial type resistors predominantly use a 4 or a 5 or a 6 band colour-coding system to indicate their resistance and tolerance 
- SMT and a few TH resistor types use a numbering scheme to indicate resistance in &ohm;
 - First 2 numbers represent the two most significant digits of the value 
 - The last number is the ten-to-the-power multiplier (e.g., 10x10<sup>4</sup> &ohm; and 10x10<sup>5</sup> &ohm;  )

]

- A handheld or a bench multimeter can be used to measure resistance of a resistor
 - Switch the multimeter in to the resistance measurement option
- Make sure the black lead is plugged to *COM* or *LO* terminal and the red lead to *&ohm;* terminal
 - If measuring large resistors avoid touching the terminals of the resistor to reduce error
- Measuring resistance of a resistor while in circuit (i.e., on PCB) is often not possible
 - Devices connected to it on the PCB will introduce an error in to the measurement

# Capacitors

- The capacitance of a capacitor made using two conducting plates, where each plate has an area, A, separated by, d, and uses insulation material between the plates with a permittivity, &epsilon;<sub>r</sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>, is given by,
\\[ C = \frac{\epsilon\_\text{r} \epsilon\_0 A}{d} \\]
- A capacitor is thus made using conducting plates that has specific area and a separation, which gives the required capacitance
 - The plates typically arranged like a multilayer "wrap" to reduce the size of the capacitor 
- A practical capacitor not only has capacitance but also has some inductance and resistance
 - Can be modelled as a capacitor, C, an Equivalent Series Inductance, ESL and an Equivalent Series Resistance, ESR

- Electrolytic capacitors are polarized and therefore can only be used in DC circuits
 - Negative terminal is usually identified by the marking and also is the shorter lead
- The anode is made from an aluminum foil and cathode is made with an paper impregnated electrolyte gel 
 - The aluminum foil has an oxide layer that acts as the insulator between the foil and the gel
 - The aluminum foil is etched to create an uneven surface and increase area

# Electrolytic Capacitors (PII)

.left-column[
- Because of the extremely small thickness of the oxide layer, capacitance value can range up to about a few Farads 
- The voltage rating can be as high as 650 V for readily available devices 
- However the electrolyte increases the equivalent resistance (ESR) and can be as high as a few ohms
 - Not suitable for high-frequency applications or decoupling
 - ESR is higher at lower operating temperatures 
- The electrolyte eventually dries off, leading to failure of the capacitor
 - Life time few thousands hours to few tens of thousands of hours
 - Life degrade rapidly with increasing operating temperature

- Made by wrapping a large number of layers of two metal foils that are separated by a dielectric material 
 - The dielectric material can be paper, polyester, polystyrene, polypropylene, etc.
- In some the dielectric foil has a thin conducting layer deposited instead of using a metal foil 
 - These are termed metalized foil capacitors 
- Extremely long life time in the order of many hundreds of thousands of hours
 - As with electrolytic capacitors, life time decrease with increasing temperature
 - Some film capacitors have self-healing properties

- Because of the thickness of the dielectric film, capacitance values are limited to 100s of &mu;F 
- The voltage rating can be as high as 10kV
 - Though capacitance is unaffected by voltage, at higher frequencies voltage applied should be reduced
- The metal foil used as electrodes helps dramatically reduce the ESR to well below 100m&ohm;
 - Though ESL of larger capacitors can be significant, film capacitors are good for decoupling
- Good for high-frequency applications as capacitance is unaffected by frequency

- The properties of the dielectric lead to different temperature coefficients and a few other characteristics 
 - Ceramic capacitors are thus often categorized based on their temperature coefficient 
 - X7R and C0G/NP0 are the two most common ceramic capacitors categories/types
- X7R capacitors are are usually cheaper and they have higher capacitances up to 10s of &mu;F

# VI Behavior of Diodes

.left-column[
- A two terminal device made using semiconductor material with a P-N junction
 - Terminal connected to P-doped region is called the anode and the one connected to the N-doped region is called the cathode
- When anode is at a higher potential than cathode (i.e., positive V<sub>AK</sub>), diode is forward biased and current flow from A to K
 - Forward voltage drop, V<sub>F</sub>, can be in the range 0.2V to about 2.5V depending on the diode type
- When V<sub>AK</sub> is negative, diode is reverse biased and only a very small leakage current flows
 - If reverse voltage rating, V<sub>R</sub>, exceeded, diode will breakdown 
 - A diode damaged by exceeding V<sub>R</sub> usually behaves like a short

# Switching Behavior of Diodes

.left-column[
- A practical diode takes a certain time to transition from forward bias to reverse bias (i.e., time to turn-off)
 - This time is referred to as the reverse recovery time, t<sub>rr</sub>
 - During t<sub>rr</sub> both I<sub>D</sub> and V<sub>AK</sub> are large leading to losses 
- Depending on rated forward current, I<sub>F</sub>, diodes can be categorized as signal diodes (I<sub>F</sub> < 200mA) or power diodes (I<sub>F</sub> > 200mA)
- Power diodes can be further categorized depending on their t<sub>rr</sub>
 - Schottky diodes are the most ideal with t<sub>rr</sub> of 0 and a V<sub>F</sub> around 0.2V-0.4V, but expensive and V<sub>r</sub> limited to about 300V
 - t<sub>rr</sub> of hyper-fast to fast diodes are in the 10s of ns to about 500ns, while V<sub>F</sub> is about 1V
 - Standard diodes are suitable for 50Hz/60Hz applications

]

- A handheld or a bench multimeter can be used to test a diode
 - Switch the multimeter in to the diode measurement option
- Make sure the black lead is plugged to *COM* or *LO* terminal and the red lead to *&ohm;* terminal
- Touch red lead to anode of the diode and black lead to cathode of the diode
 - If the diode is good it should read the forward voltage drop of diode
 - If diode is damaged it will either read open circuit or a near 0V forward drop 
- Swap the leads and ensure it reads open circuit as the diode is now reverse biased

# Diode Parameters

- There are many device parameters to consider when selecting each diode used in a design
 - Breakdown voltage, V<sub>r</sub>
 - Current rating, I<sub>F</sub>
 - Reverse recovery time, t<sub>rr</sub>
 - Forward voltage drop, V<sub>F</sub>
 - Reverse biased leakage current
 - Parasitic junction capacitance
 - Thermal resistance 
 - Type of diode (i.e., Schottky, ultra-fast, fast, standard, signal, etc.)
 - Package (i.e., through-hole, surface-mount, axial, SMA, etc.)
- In addition, cost, availability, lifecycle, etc. needs to be considered

# VI Behavior of Zener Diodes

.left-column[
- A type of a diode that maintains a nearly constant voltage across it while under reverse biased 
 - Current flows from K to A, and V<sub>AK</sub> is a nearly constant negative voltage, referred to as *Zener Voltage*,  V<sub>Z</sub>
 - The current at which nominal V<sub>Z</sub> is measured is the nominal bias current, I<sub>Z</sub>
 - Need to make sure the power dissipation in the Zener is kept below rating indicated by manufacturer
- When forward biased (i.e., positive V<sub>AK</sub>), a Zener diode behaves like a normal diode and current flow from A to K
 - Forward voltage drop is in the range 0.7V to about 2V
- Commonly used for protection and voltage regulation

# Example: Clipper Circuit 

.questions[
A voltage divider, shown below, is used to step-down 230VAC mains supply voltage before passing through a 5V signal conditioning circuitry to the ADC of an MCU. Sketch a clipper circuit that uses the BZX79-B/C2V4 Zener diodes, to ensure voltage across V<sub>vs</sub> is clipped to below &#177;5V. Sketch the voltage across V<sub>vs</sub> with this clipper circuit, when the mains voltage is 230VAC. A surge in the utility grid has caused the mains voltage to jump to 600VAC. Sketch the voltage across V<sub>vs</sub>, to show how the clipper circuit help prevent damage to your signal conditioning circuit. Instead of the BZX79-B/C2V4, can we use 1N4148 diodes to implement a clipper circuit?

# Ground Planes

.zoom175[
.center[<img src="img/GroundPlane.gif" height="200">]
]

- Current carrying traces emit electromagnetic noise as the magnitude of current changes 
 - Field emitted not only couples to neighboring traces but also to outside world 
- The amount of field coupled from one trace to the other as well as field emitted to the outside world can be reduced using a ground plane
 - The changes in current induces eddy currents in ground plane inturn producing a "cancelling field" 
- Alternatively, return trace can be placed straight below current path to reduce field emitted

# Decoupling Capacitors

.center[<img src="img/Decoup.png" height="180">]

- PCB traces and vias introduce inductance in addition to ESL of the bulk capacitors
 - This could be in the range of a few nH to tens of nH
- Trace inductances and ESL of bulk capacitors resist changes in the current demand
 - In example, when LED is turned on, inductor resists increase in current and as a result V<sub>sw1</sub> dips
- A decoupling capacitor near the "consumer" helps meet its instantaneous current demand 
 - The decoupling capacitor keeps V<sub>sw2</sub> nearly constant and minimize generation of electrical noise
- Size of decoupling capacitor depends on current drawn by "consumer" and parasitic inductances
