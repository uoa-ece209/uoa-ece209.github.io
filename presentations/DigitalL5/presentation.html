# When is Timing Required?

- Often we want to perform some action after a certain period of time
 - This could be a one time (single) action, or a repeated (periodic) action
 - As an example consider blinking an LED every 1s
- We also want to monitor activities, and want to determine for how long or how often they occur
 - As an example consider having to measure how long a button is pressed for
- All microcontrollers have a notion of time based on its clock, as each clock period is a function of the system clock frequency
\\[ T\_\mathtt{system\\\_clk} = \frac{1}{f\_\mathtt{system\\\_clk}} \\]
- Timers are peripherals which enable us to convert the `\(T_\mathtt{system\_clk}\)` either into actions in real time or to measure events in real time

---

name: S3

# Timing Without Timer Peripherals

- The microcontroller processor also has a notion of time from the system clock since the duration of each execution cycle is also
\\[ T\_\mathtt{cpu\\\_clk} = \frac{1}{f\_\mathtt{cpu\\\_clk}} \\]
- We could implement timing in software by using for example a 'dummy' block of code that uses up execution cycles
 - This is at the expense of taking up the processor time
- We also need to know exactly how many clock cycles it took to execute the block of code used for timing 
 - This can be tricky and the functionality is limited
- As an example we can use the assembly instruction **NOP** to generate a single execution cycle delay
 - In the C code having **asm("NOP");** repeated a number of times can create a given delay
 - Alternatively a loop may also be used

# Example: Timing in Software

.questions[
An ATmega328P uses a 1MHz system clock. In an embedded program you were developing, a 4&mu;s delay needed to be generated and you decided that the best option is to use **NOP** operations. 
 - How long does it take to execute a single **NOP** operation?
 - How many **NOP** operations should you execute to create a 4&mu;s delay?
 - Write the code that could be used to generate a 4&mu;s

# Timing in Your Project

.center[<img src="img/System.png" height="200">]

- The smart energy monitor needs to measure voltage and current to determine power drawn by the load
- We will need to measure these signals at regular time intervals as per project specifications
 - We may also want to for example measure time between zero crossings to determine the frequency
- We will need to update the display periodically and send data over the UART periodically
- We will use the timer peripherals on the ATmega328P to perform each of these timing tasks
 - You will need to think about the most suitable timer peripheral for each function taking in to account their characteristics and interrupt priorities

# Operating Principles of a Timer Peripheral

.center[<img src="img/TimerBasic.png" height="250">]

- A timer peripheral is implemented using a counter that counts up and/or down when its input changes
 - If counting up, the count is increased every time the input changes from low to high
 - If counting down, the count is decreased every time the input changes from low to high
- This input is often derived from the system clock directly or through a prescaler 

---
name: S7

# Timing Using a Timer Peripheral

.center[<img src="img/TimerReset.png" height="250">]

- If the counter size is 8-bits and it is counting up, it will reset to 0 at the next increment after 255
- Alternatively, the counter can be made to reset every time it reaches a specific count, referred to as **TOP**, and **TOP** should be less than largest number the counter can hold (referred to as the **MAX**)
- The event generated when a counter resets, referred to as an **overflow**, can be used for precise timing
 - Either using polling or interrupts

---
name: S8

# Using Compare Match for Timing

.center[<img src="img/TimerCompare.png" height="250">]

- A **compare** value can be used to detect when a set count value is reached
- The event generated when a **compare match** occurs can be used for precise timing
 - Either using polling or interrupts
- Overflow and compare match events can also generate a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal
 - We will talk about PWM briefly later in the lecture

---
name: S9

# Using External Clock

.center[<img src="img/ExtClock.png" height="250">]

- Rather than using the system clock to increment the count, we can use an external clock input
- Each time the external input changes from low to high, the count will increase
 - However, the timer is still synchronized to the system clock, so the count will only increase on the rising edge of the system clock

# Example: Timing with Timer Peripheral

.questions[
An ATmega328P uses a 1MHz system clock. In an embedded program you were developing, a 4&mu;s delay needed to be generated and you decided that an option is to use a timer peripheral. The timer peripheral you are using is fed directly by the system clock (i.e. prescaler is 1).
 - If you plan to use an overflow event for timing what should be the **Top** value?
 - If you plan to use a compare match event for timing what should be the **Compare** value?

# Characteristics of a Timer (PI)

- Prescaler
 - The clock divider which divides the system clock to create the timer clock
\\[ f\_\mathtt{timer\\\_clk} = \frac{f\_\mathtt{system\\\_clk}}{\text{Prescaler}} \\]
- Bits
 - The number of bits allocated to the count register
\\[ 0 \leqslant \text{count} < 2^\text{bits} \\]
- Resolution
 - This is the minimum time interval the timer can measure and is equal to one timer clock period
\\[ \text{Resolution} = \frac{1}{f\_\mathtt{timer\\\_clk}} \\]


---
name: S12

# Characteristics of a Timer (PII)

- Range
 - This is the maximum time interval the timer can measure
\\[ \text{Range} = \text{Resolution} \times \left( 2^\text{bits} - 1 \right) \\]
- Top
 - The count value at which the count is reset
 - Top must be less than or equal to the maximum possible count value which can be stored with the available bits
- Period
 - The time interval taken for the count to return to the starting value
 - As the transition from top to ‘0’ takes one cycle, we must add 1 to the top to calculate the period
\\[ \text{Period} = \text{Resolution} \times \left( \text{Top} + 1 \right) \\]

# Example: ATmega328P 8-Bit Timer

.questions[
An ATmega328P uses a 16MHz system clock. Assume you plan to use one of the 8-bit timer peripherals in the ATmega328P. You have decided to use a prescaler of 4. 
 - What is the resolution you can achieve?
 - What is the range you can achieve?
 - What should be used as the top value to get a period of 50&mu;s?

# Clear Timer on Compare Match

.center[<img src="img/CTCMode.png" height="190">]

- Before using a timer we need to decide on what mode we want to use it in
 - In this lecture we are going to operate TC0 in *Clear Timer on Compare Match (CTC)* mode
- In CTC mode, TCNT0 counts up starting from 0, where TCNT0 is incremented by 1 every timer clock cycle
- TCNT0 value is compared with OCR0A value we will define and when they match, TCNT0 will be set to 0 (i.e. cleared)
 - OCF0A flag will be set when a match occurs and is cleared either by writing a 1 to OCF0A or executing the corresponding interrupt

---
name: S25

# Configuring TC0 in CTC Mode

- First we need to configure TC0 as per our needs
 - Need to set the bits of the [TCCR0A](#S18) and [TCCR0B](#S19) registers 
 - Do this in an initialization function
- In the lectures, as an example, we will configure the TC0 in CTC mode with a prescaler of 8 
- We want the timer to have period of 1ms so we can create our own millisecond delay
 - Since the ATmega328P uses a 2MHz system clock, to achieve this we need to load 249 to OCR0A

.codes[
```c
//This function configures TC0 to operate in CTC mode with a period of 1ms
//The prescaler of 8 needed is not loaded to keep timer stopped until it is used 
void tc0_init(void){
  TCCR0A = 0b00000010;    //WGM0[2..0] should be set to 010 for CTC mode
  TCCR0B = 0b00000000;    //Initialize CS0[2..0] to 000 so that timer is stopped until needed
                          //When running we need to load 010 to CS0[2..0] for a prescaler of 8
  OCR0A = 249;            //Loading OCR0A with 249 to get a period of 1ms
}
```
]

---
name: S26

# Creating Custom Delay Function

- Lets develop our own millisecond delay function that uses TC0 with polling 
- The function waits for OCR0A match by polling the OCF0A flag 
 - Since an OCR0A match event occur every 1ms it repeats this for the number of ms requested

.codes[

# Using the Delay Function

- Lets now use the delay function we wrote to toggle an LED at PB5 every 0.5s
- The two TC0 related functions we developed earlier are put in a source file named *tc0.c* and it has a corresponding header file called *tc0.h*

.codes[
```c
#include <avr/io.h>       //Needed for using the macros for register addresses
#include "tc0.h"          //Including our TC0 peripheral library

int main(void){
  tc0_init();             //Initializing TC0 to work in CTC mode with 1ms period 
  DDRB |= 1 << PINB5;     //Setting PB5 as output
    
  while (1){
    tc0_ms_delay(500);    //Create a 0.5s delay
    PORTB ^= 1 << PINB5;  //Toggle PB5 
  }
}

```

# Pulse Width Modulation

.center[<img src="img/PWM1.png" height="170">]

- We often want to produce a periodically pulsating signals that has a fixed time period (T<sub>p</sub>)
 - The pulsating signal is high (logic 1) for a certain portion of T<sub>p</sub> and this time is called the on-time (T<sub>on</sub>)
 - For the remainder of T<sub>p</sub> the pulsating signal is low (logic 0) and this time is called the off-time (T<sub>off</sub>)
\\[ T\_\text{p} = T\_\text{on} + T\_\text{off} \\]
- In many application we control the duration of T<sub>on</sub> to control the “pulse width”
 - These signals are known as pulse-width modulated (PWM) signals

# DC Value of a PWM Signal

.center[<img src="img/PWM2.png" height="170">]

- PWM signals produced by an MCU often control BJT/MOSFET switches to produce an amplified voltage (V<sub>supply</sub>) during T<sub>on</sub>  
 - V<sub>supply</sub> can be any voltage ranging from a few volts to thousands of volts
- Pulsating V<sub>supply</sub> can be turned in to a DC signal by passing it through an analog low-pass filter 
 - The DC signal can be controlled using T<sub>on</sub>/T<sub>p</sub>, which is referred to as the duty-cycle (D)
\\[ V\_\text{DC} = V\_\text{supply} \times \frac{T\_\text{on}}{T\_\text{p}} = D \cdot V\_\text{supply} \\]

# Using Timer to Generate a PWM Signal

- In a timer, the count value is reset when it reaches the **Top** value, which sets the timer period
 - We can use this property to generate T<sub>p</sub> of a PWM signal
- A compare match event can be used to drive the digital I/O pins connected to OCnA/OCnB when count value reaches the compare value
 - We can use this property to set T<sub>on</sub> of the PWM, by setting the output state of OCnA/OCnB to low when every time a compare match is achieved
- The output state of OCnA/OCnB can be configured to be set to high when the count value resets
- Since we have to add 1 when calculating periods, this results in a PWM output where 
\\[ T\_\text{p} = \text{Resolution} \times \left( \text{Top} + 1 \right) = \frac{\text{Top} + 1}{f\_\mathtt{timer\\\_clk}}\\]
\\[ T\_\text{on} = \text{Resolution} \times \left( \text{Compare} + 1 \right) = \frac{\text{Compare} + 1}{f\_\mathtt{timer\\\_clk}}\\]
- The compare value can be changed between 0 and Top to change the duty-cycle between 0% and 100%

# An Example PWM Signal 

- As an example lets consider a counter that has the Top set to 5, and the compare value set to 3
 - Assume the resolution of the counter is 10&mu;s (i.e. f<sub>timer_clk</sub> is 100kHz)
- In this example, T<sub>p</sub> will be 60&mu;s and T<sub>on</sub> will be 40&mu;s (i.e. D is 66.6%)

# Code for the Example PWM

- An initialization function can be developed for the ATmeage328P to setup TC0 in the fast PWM mode with a Top of 5 and a compare value of 3

.codes[
```c
void tc0_PWM_init(void){
  DDRD |= 1 << PIND5;     //PD5, which is the OC0B pin is set to an output

  //Configure the timer to operate in the Fast PWM mode with OCR0A as Top and a prescaler of 8
  TCCR0A = 0b00100011;    //Set to clear OC0B on compare match and set OC0B at BOTTOM
  TCCR0B = 0b00001010;    //Setup prescaler to 8 and the mode to Fast PWM
	
  //Setup the period and the on-time of the PWM
  OCR0A = 5;              //Set the TOP value to 5
  OCR0B = 3;              //Set the compare value to 3
}
```
]

- The main function only has to call this initialization function at the start to run the PWM in the background (i.e. does not require processor cycles)
