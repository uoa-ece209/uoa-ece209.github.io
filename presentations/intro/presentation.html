# Energy Management

.left-column[
- Managing energy flow in a DEG systems is very challenging
 - Many distributed sources, loads and storage systems need to be concurrently managed
- A smarter grid with many smart sensors that monitor the flow of energy is a key solution
 - Enables making smart decisions to effectively manage the generation, utilization, storage and retrieval of energy 
 - Smart appliances, storage systems and controllers use this information to control the energy flow 
- Many smart metering/monitoring solutions have been developed
 - Smart meters report house-hold consumption to retailer 
 - Smart energy monitors can monitor energy consumed by a specific load

# The Project

- What is this course about and what should you expect to learn?
 - Gives you an opportunity to put in to practice some of the theories (analog electronics & embedded software development) you learnt to design and engineer a solution to a 'real life problem'
 - During this process you will gain fundamental knowledge, experience, skill-set and professional behavior needed to succeed in the more challenging design projects you will engage
 in the future
- What would you design and engineer during this course?
 - An energy monitor to measure and display the amount of energy consumed by a household appliance
- How would you achieve this task?
 - The voltage and current at the input to appliance is measured using __analog circuitry__ consisting of sensors, amplifiers and filters 
 - An __embedded software program__ executed on a microcontroller converts the analog signals to digital form and calculates the energy consumption together with other important information
 - The information is shown on a __local LCD display__ and also communicated __wirelessly using Bluetooth__ with other smart devices

---
name: S15

# System to Implement

- To simplify the design, we will consider a scaled-down system, which uses a low-voltage
AC source 
 - The AC source frequency is 500 Hz (oppose to 50 Hz grid frequency) to reduce the size of the AC load
 - An AC load, consisting of a variable resistor in series with a fixed inductor, is used to emulate an house-hold appliance

# Working in Teams

- You will work in a team of 4 
 - You can chose your team members and register your group details on Canvas by the end of 1st week
 - All team members should be from the same lab stream (NB: There is only one lab streams this year)
- Throughout the project work as a team and aim to support each other
 - This is an important part of preparing to be a professional engineer
 - You depend on each other to do well in this course
- Plan your work, document your work and communicate regularly with your team members
 - Use a logbook and/or [Trello](https://trello.com) to plan and document your work 
 - Use [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/) and [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for team communications
 - Use [GitHub](https://github.com) and [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com)/[Office 365](https://www.library.auckland.ac.nz/services/it-essentials/computer-facilities/software-personal-use/microsoft-student-advantage-office-365) products to collaborate with team members
- Be patient with your team members even if they are not making much progress during the initial stage
 - If things are not working out, after about 1-2 weeks, let us know
 - If a member is not engaging in team work we will ask that person to work alone

# How to Get an Excellent Grade

- Is the project challenging?
 - Yes, because this is your first real-world engineering design project
 - Due to lack of experience it is common to encounter unforeseen design and integration issues when developing a system, especially with a hardware-software interface
- What are the most challenging aspects?
 - Time management, planing and team work are the key challenges
 - As in a real life project, resources are limited (time, teams' availability, lab space, equipment, software licenses, etc.) and therefore last minute frantic endeavour will not help
- How could I get an excellent grade?
 - Enjoy designing a real-world product and be passionate about your design (this is the key ingredient)
 - Plan and manage your and your team members' time well
 - Throughout the semester you are expected to spend about 12 hours a week on the project 
 - Make full use of all lab sessions and staff support provided (there will be in average of about 10 support hours a week)

# Progress Review, Interview & Deliverables

- Just before the mid-semester break we will review your progress
 - An analog circuit that meets all the needs of the project needs to be successfully designed, simulated and validated
 - An embedded software program that can transmit data from the ATmega328P/PB via UART to a terminal should be successfully implemented and validated
 - A short interview will be held to assess your circuit (2%), software (1%) and your understanding (3%)
- During the last week of the semester there will be an interview to evaluate your design as well as your understanding of the subject matter
 - Design will be evaluated based on functionality (4%), measurement accuracy (5%) and quality (4%) 
 - We will check how well you have used logbook/Trello, GitHub and Slack to plan, manage and document the work (2%)
 - Theoretical and practical knowledge of electronics (7%) and programming (7%) concepts you gained during the project will be assessed __individually__ during the interview

# Collaborating with Team Members

- To be a good engineer you also need to develop a number of *soft-skills*
 - Some of the key skills you should aim to develop are management, teamwork and communication 
- One of the primary responsibilities you will have as an engineer is to tell other engineers how to build, service, use and update a product you have been involved in designing/developing/building/testing/etc.
 - Thus, engineers are expected to document all details about their work in a logbook 
 - The information recorded in a logbook include, design notes, design decisions, calculations, software flow diagrams, schematics, meeting minutes, etc. 
- In industry, many different digital tools are used to help with managing teamwork work, communicating with team members and documenting details of the project
 - Trello, Slack and GitHub are a few such most commonly used and simple to use tools 
- In this project all students are expected to use a logbook and/or Trello together with Slack and GitHub to effectively plan, manage and document the work
 - We will regularly check how you use these tools as part of the assessment process

# Winter & Respiratory Viruses

- The course will be predominantly delivered in person unless UoA protocols change during the semester 
- There are about 160+ students in this course and they are supported by about 20+ TAs
 - Health and safety of everyone is a priority and so, if a TA is ill we would have to find replacements 
- We need to try and minimize the spread of respiratory viruses especially since it is winter
 - Students should wear face masks and try to minimize the spread of viruses 
 - If you are sick, you can participate virtually in support and assessment sessions (or in some cases you can request to reschedule your assessments)
- At times we may have TA shortages and might be forced to conduct support and assessment sessions virtually (or reschedule assessment times)
 - We will discuss with affected students and organize alternatives 
- If you test positive for COVID and think you have had contact with TAs during infectious time period notify Duleepa

# Enrolment & Software Installation

- Prerequisite for this course are ELECTENG 291 (or ELECTENG 202) and COMPSYS 201
 - If you have failed any of these courses, please contact us to check if your enrolment is still valid
- Students are also expected to have passed ELECTENG 101 
 - ELECTENG 209 heavily relies on the knowledge you should have gained from core ECSE papers (i.e. ELECTENG 101, ELECTENG 202/291 and COMPSYS 201)
 - To help you revise, teaching material from these courses are also made available through the Canvas page for ELECTENG 209
- In some cases, even if you do not meet the prerequisites, after an interview, we may allow you to continue with the course, but we will have to partner you with a suitable group 
 - Contact Duleepa for more information
- Follow details on Canvas or the [course website](https://uoa-ece209.github.io/extra.html) to get setup on Piazza, Slack and GitHub

# Building a Prototype

- This is a design project and you are expected to develop a hardware prototype 
 - This includes breadboarding, assembling PCBs, testing hardware, building final prototype, etc.
- We will provide resources and tools to get started on the project before you get to the stage of building your own prototype analog circuitry
 - You can use Proteus VSM and the Xplained Mini development boards to develop and validate most of your software
 - We will provide a hardware emulator that can be connected with the Xplained Mini for further debugging and validation by emulating the signals you expect to get from your own analog circuitry
- The lab benches in MDLS E&I labs will be equipped with low-voltage AC power sources and variable load banks
 - The sources generate 12.6 V<sub>RMS</sub> to 15.4 V<sub>RMS</sub>, 500 Hz AC voltage
 - The variable resistor in the load can be used to change the VA drawn by it between 2.5VA and 7.5VA
- We will have a number of workshops to teach you how to build and test your hardware
