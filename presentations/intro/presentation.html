# Energy Management

.left-column[
- Managing energy flow in a DEG systems is very challenging
 - Many distributed sources, loads and storage systems need to be concurrently managed
- A smarter grid with many smart sensors that monitor the flow of energy is a key solution
 - Enables making smart decisions to effectively manage the generation, utilization, storage and retrieval of energy 
 - Smart appliances, storage systems and controllers use this information to control the energy flow 
- Many smart metering/monitoring solutions have been developed
 - Smart meters report house-hold consumption to retailer 
 - Smart energy monitors can monitor energy consumed by a specific load

# The Project

- What is this course about and what should you expect to learn?
 - Gives you an opportunity to put in to practice some of the theories (analog electronics & embedded software development) you learnt to design and engineer a solution to a 'real life problem'
 - During this process you will gain fundamental knowledge, experience, skill-set and professional behavior needed to succeed in the more challenging design projects you will engage
 in the future
- What would you design and engineer during this course?
 - An energy monitor to measure and display the amount of energy consumed by a household appliance
- How would you achieve this task?
 - The voltage and current at the input to appliance is measured using __analog circuitry__ consisting of sensors, amplifiers and filters 
 - An __embedded software program__ executed on a microcontroller converts the analog signals to digital form and calculates the energy consumption together with other important information
 - The information is shown on a __local LCD display__ and also communicated __wirelessly using Bluetooth/WiFi__ with other smart devices

---
name: S15

# System to Implement

- To simplify the design, we will consider a scaled-down system, which uses a low-voltage
AC source 
 - The AC source frequency is 500 Hz (oppose to 50 Hz grid frequency) to reduce the size of the AC load
 - An AC load, consisting of a variable resistor in series with a fixed inductor, is used to emulate an house-hold appliance

# Working in Teams

- You will work in a team of 4 
 - You can chose your team members and register your group details on Canvas by the end of 1st week
 - All team members should be from the same lab stream 
- Throughout the project work as a team and aim to support each other
 - This is an important part of preparing to be a professional engineer
 - You depend on each other to do well in this course
- Plan your work, document your work and communicate regularly with your team members
 - Use a logbook to plan and document your work 
 - Use [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/) and [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for team communications
 - Use [GitHub](https://github.com) and [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com)/[Office 365](https://www.library.auckland.ac.nz/services/it-essentials/computer-facilities/software-personal-use/microsoft-student-advantage-office-365) products to collaborate with team members
- Be patient with your team members even if they are not making much progress during the initial stage
 - If things are not working out, after about 1-2 weeks, let us know
 - If a member is not engaging in team work we will ask that person to work alone

# How to Get an Excellent Grade

- Is the project challenging?
 - Yes, because this is your first real-world engineering design project
 - Due to lack of experience it is common to encounter unforeseen design and integration issues when developing a system, especially with a hardware-software interface
- What are the most challenging aspects?
 - Time management, planing and team work are the key challenges
 - As in a real life project, resources are limited (time, teams' availability, lab space, equipment, software licenses, etc.) and therefore last minute frantic endeavour will not help
- How could I get an excellent grade?
 - Enjoy designing a real-world product and be passionate about your design (this is the key ingredient)
 - Plan and manage your and your team members' time well
 - Throughout the semester you are expected to spend about 12 hours a week on the project 
 - Make full use of all lab sessions and staff support provided (there will be in average of about 10 support hours a week)

---
name: S26B

# Lab Access  

- You will have guaranteed access to the lab only during the scheduled lab sessions
- If you have completed the safety induction, the risk assessment and the other required paper work for after-hours access, you can access the lab anytime between 7.30am and 9pm on weekdays and weekends
 - Make sure to use the labs when not occupied by other courses 
- The soldering lab is only open during work hours and it is heavily used by others too
- You are expected to plan your work and use the lab time effectively as it would be difficult to complete the project without access to the resources in the lab
- To help with time management, the labs assessments will guide you through most of the critical tasks
- Note that developing a PCB, assembling and testing it is a time consuming task
 - Allow time during the mid-semester break to complete the PCB design specially if you like to master the PCB design process
- If you are doing the optional design challenges, you must allow time during the mid-semester break to work on this as it takes considerable time
 - There will be limited support available during the mid-semester break

# Assessment Components

- All assessment components are compulsory
- To obtain a passing grade for this course, **the average score of the 2 tests MUST be over 40%**
  - E.g., if you score 30% in test 1 and 60% in test 2, your average is 45% and you will pass the course
  - E.g., if you score 30% in test 1 and 40% in test 2, your average is 35% and you will **fail the course**
- Although this project will be undertaken in design teams of 4, you will be assessed individually

# Collaborating with Team Members

- To be a good engineer you also need to develop a number of *soft-skills*
 - Some of the key skills you should aim to develop are management, teamwork and communication 
- One of the primary responsibilities you will have as an engineer is to tell other engineers how to build, service, use and update a product you have been involved in designing/developing/building/testing/etc.
 - Thus, engineers are expected to document all details about their work in a logbook 
 - The information recorded in a logbook include, design notes, design decisions, calculations, software flow diagrams, schematics, meeting minutes, etc. 
- In industry, many different digital tools are used to help with managing teamwork work, communicating with team members and documenting details of the project
 - Slack and GitHub are a few such most commonly used and simple to use tools 
- In this project all students are expected to use a logbook together with Slack and GitHub to effectively plan, manage and document the work
 - We will regularly check how you use these tools as part of the assessment process
