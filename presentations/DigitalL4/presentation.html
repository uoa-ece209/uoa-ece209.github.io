# The Voltage Measurement

.center[<img src="img/VoltageCct.png" height="150">]

- The step down in voltage achieved by the voltage divider can be quantified by a gain G<sub>vs</sub> 
 - In your design G<sub>vs</sub> = R<sub>b</sub> / (R<sub>a</sub> + R<sub>b</sub> )
- The differential amplifier provide a gain G<sub>vo</sub> and an offset V<sub>off</sub>
 - In your design G<sub>vo</sub> = R<sub>2</sub> / R<sub>1</sub> 
- The gain of the passive RC filter, G<sub>vf</sub>, is 1 in your design
- The analog signal at the ADC, V<sub>vf</sub>, is therefore 

\\[ V\_\text{vf} = G\_\text{vs} G\_\text{vo} V\_\text{AC} + V\_\text{off} \\]

---

name: S3

# The Current Measurement

.center[<img src="img/CurrentCct.png" height="150">]

- The relation with I<sub>L</sub> and V<sub>is</sub> can be quantified by a gain G<sub>is</sub> 
 - In your design G<sub>is</sub> = R<sub>s</sub> 
- The differential amplifier provide a gain G<sub>io</sub> and an offset V<sub>off</sub>
 - In your design G<sub>io</sub> = R<sub>2</sub> / R<sub>1</sub> 
- The gain of the passive RC filter, G<sub>if</sub>, is 1 in your design
- The analog signal at the ADC, V<sub>if</sub>, is therefore 

\\[ V\_\text{if} = G\_\text{is} G\_\text{io} I\_\text{L} + V\_\text{off} \\]

# ADC Data Representing Voltage

.center[<img src="img/VoltageData.png" height="165">]

- In this lecture, lets assume a 50Hz V<sub>vf</sub> at ADC0 is sampled and converted to an ADC value every 2ms
- Note that project specifications limits maximum sampling rate to 10kHz and therefore if repeatedly a sample of V<sub>vf</sub> is taken followed by a sample of V<sub>if</sub> then each V<sub>vf</sub> sample will be 0.2ms apart
 - Alternatively V<sub>vf</sub> can be continuously sampled over a few periods to take samples of V<sub>vf</sub> every 0.1ms  
 - Need zero crossing detector to correctly align the V<sub>if</sub> samples taken after this with the V<sub>vf</sub> samples
- From the ADC data we can estimate the AC source voltage at i<sup>th</sup> sample point since 
\\[ V\_\text{AC}[i] = \tfrac {\mathtt{ADC0Value}[i] \times \frac{5}{1024} - V\_\text{off}} {G\_\text{vs} G\_\text{vo}} \\]

# ADC Data Representing Current

.center[<img src="img/CurrentData.png" height="165">]

- Similar to V<sub>vf</sub> lets assume a 50Hz V<sub>if</sub> at ADC1 is sampled and converted to an ADC value every 2ms
- Project specifications limits maximum sampling rate to 10kHz and therefore if repeatedly a sample of V<sub>vf</sub> is taken followed by a sample of V<sub>if</sub> then each V<sub>if</sub> sample will be 0.2ms apart
 - Alternatively V<sub>if</sub> can be continuously sampled over a few periods to take samples of V<sub>if</sub> every 0.1ms  
 - Need zero crossing detector to correctly align the V<sub>if</sub> samples with the V<sub>vf</sub> samples
- From the ADC data we can estimate the AC load current at i<sup>th</sup> sample point since 
\\[ I\_\text{L}[i] = \tfrac {\mathtt{ADC1Value}[i] \times \frac{5}{1024} - V\_\text{off}} {G\_\text{is} G\_\text{io}} \\]

# Voltage & Current Samples 

.center[<img src="img/VnI.png" height="270">]

- When repeatedly a sample of V<sub>vf</sub> is taken followed by a sample of V<sub>if</sub> these samples will be 1ms apart
 - This delay can introduce a *perceived* phase-shift (i.e. phase error)  
 - With good signal processing techniques this error can be minimized
- During the project you are encouraged to investigate and improve on the techniques taught in this lecture

# Finding Max of ADC Samples

.center[<img src="img/Peak.png" height="190">]

- With a limited sampling rate and without a method to synchronize the sampling to align with a peak we cannot measure the peak accurately by sampling just one cycle of the signal
 - Notice in example above, that while during the first cycle the ADC data does not capture the peak, during the second cycle it does
- The signal can be sampled over a large number of cycles to capture the peak as long as sampling frequency is not an integer multiplication of the signal frequency
 - This process takes time

# Using a Peak Detector Circuit

.center[<img src="img/PeakDet.png" height="150">]

- A dedicated peak detector circuit could be used to detect the peak
- A diode and a capacitor can be used to sample the peak 
 - Works like a half-wave rectifier
 - A resistor, R<sub>bld</sub>, is needed to bleed the charge in C<sub>pk</sub> so a peak value that changes over time can be monitored (the RC time constant needs to be larger than the period of the signal)
 - Alternatively, a switch, S<sub>rst</sub>, can be used to reset the peak detector by discharging C<sub>pk</sub> regularly through a resistor, R<sub>rst</sub>
- The forward voltage drop across diode significantly impacts the accuracy  

---
name: S9

# An Improved Peak Detector Circuit

.center[<img src="img/SuperD.png" height="200">]

- To overcome the forward voltage drop of the diode a *superdiode* can be used
- When V<sub>AC</sub> is greater than V<sub>pk</sub>, the op-amp forward biases the diode completing negative feedback loop
 - Op-amp acts as a follower and C<sub>pk</sub> charges to peak value of V<sub>AC</sub>  
 - The maximum peak value that can be tracked is equal to V<sub>OH</sub> - V<sub>F</sub>, where V<sub>F</sub> is the forward voltage drop of the diode
- A mechanism to discharge C<sub>pk</sub> is still required so a peak value that changes over time can be monitored

# Estimating RMS Using Peak 

- [Recall](#S7) that we have already learnt how to obtain the peak of a signal
- Assuming this signal is sinusoidal, the peak value is related to the RMS value as given by

\\[ \text{RMS} = \frac {\text{Peak}} {\sqrt{2}} \\]

- The assumption of a sinusoidal signal is not always correct, especially in a practical design, as V<sub>ac</sub> and I<sub>L</sub> are often distorted sinusoidal signals
 - The distortions in the signals lead to significant errors in the RMS estimate when using this method
- We can improve the accuracy by developing software to implement the RMS formula given by

\\[ V\_\text{AC(RMS)} = \sqrt {\frac {1} {T\_\text{p}} \int\_{0}^{T\_\text{p}} {V\_\text{AC}^2 \,dt}}  \quad \text{or} \quad I\_\text{L(RMS)} = \sqrt {\frac {1} {T\_\text{p}} \int\_{0}^{T\_\text{p}} {I\_\text{L}^2 \,dt}}\\]

# Riemann Sum 

- RMS formula can be converted in to a form that can be evaluated in an MCU by applying it to ADC data
- The integral term in the RMS formula can be evaluated in an MCU using the Riemann sum 
 - The area under a curve is divided  in to a number of rectangles where the height of these rectangles are evaluated using the ADC data of the signal
 - The width of each rectangle is equal to time between 2 ADC samples of the signal &#916;t<sub>sample</sub>
 - By adding the areas of each rectangle we can evaluate the integral
 - Trapezoidal rule and a number of other more advanced methods can also be used

# Calculating the RMS Numerically 

.center[<img src="img/Vrms.png" height="220">]

- If we have taken N ADC samples at regular &#916;t<sub>sample</sub> intervals over one time period of the signal, the time period T<sub>p</sub> = N&#916;t<sub>sample</sub>
- We can square each V<sub>AC</sub> or I<sub>L</sub> sample and use Riemann sum to numerically evaluate the RMS as given by

\\[ V\_\text{AC(RMS)}^2 = \frac {1}{N \Delta t\_\text{sample}} \sum\_{i=0}^{N-1} V\_\text{AC}^2[i] \cdot \Delta t\_\text{sample} \quad \text{or} \quad I\_\text{L(RMS)}^2 = \frac {1}{N \Delta t\_\text{sample}} \sum\_{i=0}^{N-1} I\_\text{L}^2[i] \cdot \Delta t\_\text{sample}\\]

# Time Between Zero Crossings

.center[<img src="img/PF.png" height="190">]

- Because of the limited sampling frequency, using ADC data to calculate the time between voltage and current zero-crossings introduces significant error
- Comparators can be used to detect the zero-crossings and generate rising or falling edge signals
 - To avoid noise from generating false edges, filtered signals should be fed to the comparators
- The edges can be used as interrupts to control a timer to obtain the time, T<sub>zc</sub>, between edges
 - We can estimate power factor angle, &#952;, by looking at the time between the zero-crossings of the voltage and current waveforms since &#952; = 360<sup>0</sup> T<sub>zc</sub> / T<sub>p</sub>

# Estimating Power Using RMSs

- [Recall](#S10) that we have already learnt how to obtain the RMS of V<sub>AC</sub> and I<sub>L</sub>
- Assuming V<sub>AC</sub> and I<sub>L</sub> are sinusoidal, the power is related to their RMS values and the power factor angle as given by

\\[ P = V\_\text{AC(RMS)} I\_\text{L(RMS)} \cos(\theta) \\]

- The assumption of a sinusoidal signal is not always correct, especially in a practical design, as V<sub>ac</sub> and I<sub>L</sub> are often distorted sinusoidal signals
 - The distortions in the signals lead to significant errors in the power estimate when using RMSs and the power factor angle
- We can improve the accuracy by developing software to implement the power formula given by

\\[ P =  \frac {1} {T\_\text{p}} \int\_{0}^{T\_\text{p}} {V\_\text{AC} I\_\text{L} \,dt}  \\]

# Calculating Power Numerically 

.left-column[
- Assume we have taken N ADC samples of both V<sub>AC</sub> and I<sub>L</sub>
 - Samples of V<sub>AC</sub> as well as I<sub>L</sub> are at regular &#916;t<sub>sample</sub> intervals
- We can multiply each V<sub>AC</sub> sample with corresponding I<sub>L</sub> sample to numerically evaluate power as given by

\\[ P = \frac {1}{N \Delta t\_\text{sample}} \sum\_{i=0}^{N-1} \left( V\_\text{AC}[i] \cdot I\_\text{L}[i] \cdot \Delta t\_\text{sample} \right) = \frac {1}{N} \sum\_{i=0}^{N-1} \left( V\_\text{AC}[i]\cdot I\_\text{L}[i] \right)\\]

- Since the two ADC channels are sampled one after the other, there is a time delay between each sample of V<sub>AC</sub> and its corresponding I<sub>L</sub> sample
 - This can lead to a significant error in power calculation in the form of a phase-shift

# Linear Approximation of Missing Data 

.left-column[
- The missing V<sub>AC</sub> and I<sub>L</sub> samples can be approximated using the average of the samples from either side (i.e. linear approximation)

\\[ \bar{V}\_\text{AC}[i] = \frac {V\_\text{AC}[i] + V\_\text{AC}[i+1]} {2} \\]
\\[ \bar{I}\_\text{L}[i] = \frac {I\_\text{L}[i-1] + I\_\text{L}[i]} {2} \\]

- How can we estimate the 11<sup>th</sup> sample of V<sub>AC</sub> and the -1<sup>th</sup> sample of I<sub>L</sub>?
- Power can now be evaluated as given by

\\[ P = \frac {1}{2N} \sum\_{i=0}^{N-1} \left[ V\_\text{AC}[i] \cdot \bar{I}\_\text{L}[i] + \bar{V}\_\text{AC}[i] \cdot I\_\text{L}[i] \right] \\]
